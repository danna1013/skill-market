# Review Notes

## Pages checked:
1. Home page - Hero, Stats, Featured, Popular, CTA, Footer - all rendering well
2. Skills page - Search, categories, grid view, all 18 cards - working
3. Skill Detail page - Header, tabs, install, author, details sidebar - working
4. Upload page - (need to check)

## Issues found:
- Stats section numbers are animating but the counter section could use more visual polish
- The "Highlighted Skills" horizontal scroll cards look good
- Overall dark glass aesthetic is consistent and premium

## Optimizations to make:
1. Add smooth scroll behavior to html
2. Improve the NotFound page styling to match theme
3. Add prefers-reduced-motion support
4. Ensure mobile responsiveness is solid
